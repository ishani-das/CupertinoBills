# Cupertino Bills
A website designed to provide easy and accessible information on local bills.

# Who are we?
Our names are Ishani Das and Vaishanvi Kouru, and we are both rising sophomores at Cupertino High School.

# Why did we create this site?
As it is known, the most powerful way to prevent infringement of the citizens' civil rights is to keep ourselves informed.
Currently, staying up to date on local policies is tedious. It's our mission to make this information easily accessible to anyone who is interested. Right now, this website caters to people residing in Cupertino, CA.
